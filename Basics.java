//Why is java platform independent language?

// source code of java -> class ( converst machine code to bytecode)-> jvm ( interpreter)-> OS
// java is platform independent language because of jvm

//in c++ diorect mcahine code gets run on os but in java bytecode gets run on jvm and jvm is platform dependent so java is platform independent language

//if we compile c++ code on windows we can run it in mac bcz iyt wil;l have the system calls of windows . But in java if we compile the code sdince it has jvm we can run it anywhere

// jdk & jre are plaqytform dependent - os specific wheras jvm is os specific but bytecode is platform independent.


// jdk - includes jre + development tols(javac , dubugger )
// jre - jvm + libraries (runtime environment)
// jvm - classloader + JIT Compiler and garbage collector


// jdk - writing amd compiling java code
// jre - running java code
// jvm - running bytecode
