//Why is java platform independent language?

// source code of java -> class ( converst machine code to bytecode)-> jvm ( interpreter)-> OS
// java is platform independent language because of jvm

//in c++ diorect mcahine code gets run on os but in java bytecode gets run on jvm and jvm is platform dependent so java is platform independent language

//if we compile c++ code on windows we can run it in mac bcz iyt wil;l have the system calls of windows . But in java if we compile the code sdince it has jvm we can run it anywhere
